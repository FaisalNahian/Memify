					<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
							<p>Memify takes user privacy pretty dang seriously. 
							Our goal is to make Memify a great experience. 
							However, as much as we love you, we are not 
							interested in knowing everything about you. Here's 
							the scoop in layman's terms: &nbsp;the collection, use, 
							and preservation of personal information by Memify 
							will only happen for making Memify a better, faster, 
							or more convenient for you. The disclosure of 
							personal information will never occur without your 
							explicit consent. This Privacy Policy  describes how we treat the information we collect when you visit and use the 
							app/website available at apps.facebook.com/memify-u and is made available under the Creative Commons Sharealike license. Please read this notice very carefully.</p>
							<h4>So, does Memify use cookies?</h4>
							<p>Yes, Memify does set cookies to make your 
							experience better. No, you can't eat these cookies! 
							&nbsp;A cookie is actually a small data file that is 
							transferred to your device. Most Internet browsers 
							automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your 
							browser to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you 
							before accepting a cookie from any website you 
							visit. If you do this, it's possible that Memify 
							might not work as well as we want it to.</p>
							<h4>Are the images I upload to Memify public?</h4>
							<p>Yes. Yes siree bob.</p>
							<h4>Can anyone use my image?</h4>
							<p>No silly, only your friends will be able to use 
							your images if they are made available. The copyright for 
							the image remains with you even after you use 
							Memify.</p>
							<h4>Will any of my personal information be shared 
							with 3rd parties?</h4>
							<p>No. Not at all. However, this Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that memify does not own or control, or employees that memify does not manage. The 
							app may contain links to third party websites. Any 
							information you provide to, or that is collected by, 
							third-party sites may be subject to the privacy 
							policies of those sites, if any. We encourage you to 
							read such privacy policies of any third-party sites 
							you visit.</p>
							<h4>Will this privacy policy change?</h4>
							<p>As Memify evolves, this privacy policy is 
							likely to evolve with it. We will not reduce your 
							rights under this Policy without your explicit 
							consent. We will post any Policy changes on this 
							page and, if the changes are significant, we will 
							provide a more prominent notice.</p>
							<p>If you've got any questions or concerns, please 
							feel free to contact us via <a href="mailto:buzz@heyfaisal.com"><u>email</u></a>.</p>
